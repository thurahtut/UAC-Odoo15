Displays the total balance by account internal group in the journal entries. This could
be necesssary in some context. For example, when looking at the stock journal entries
we would like to see the total assets, as long as we would like to see the assets
increasing when there is a debit in the inventory account and deceasing when the
inventory is decreased. The standard field amount_total_signed does not serve, as
it shows this as a positive value in this case.
